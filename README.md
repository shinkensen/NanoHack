# NanoHack
Nano sized Handheld Linux pc/ Gaming device/Emulator/Web browser/Pictures from camera analyzer, the NanoHack is a multipurpose machine capapble of suporting your needs while being as mobile as a Switch.


# What and Why:

The NanoHack's giant battery capcity enables it to run at full speeds for hours on end, its powerful processor allows for even productivity tasks to be accomplished easily with a wirelss mouse and keyboard. The NanoHack has been built up from the ground on a principle of
integrating gaming and productivity capacity into a streamlined mobile touchscreen product that can do it all. To put it bluntly, the NanoHack solves the problem that me and thousands of otherpeople across the globe have had: No device portable enogh to do serious work on,
carry with you easily, and also be able to game on! Every device like the Laptop (Too big and heavy to work on in places like in bed laying down or to use in one hand while holding coffee in the other) or smatphone (Too small to do serious work on, not a very good 
experience) has their drawbacks, yet the NanoHack solves this by being in a tiny form factor yet delivering capability on multiple fronts.


# How:
Now, reading this you may ask how is this accomplished? This was made by using a raspberry pi 5 4gb (Good Gaming and Productvity performance), 8000 mAh Battery, Adafruit 1000C, push buttons, female-female jumper wires, 7 inch ips touch screen, fully 3d printed shell, and a
128gb storage device. This will utilize the wifi and bt function of raspberry pi's too, that will make stuff like watching youtube, browsing the internet, posting smth on twitter, gaming online, google docs, even github all accesible through this small form factor. IF you 
want use this as a more mobile device, even ANDROID is usable on this via Emteria.OS. There are just so many uses and possibilities for this, and thats not even mentioning the fact that you can run c++ code on linux itself and use ides. Overall this is the PERFECT device 
for any hack club member and even normal users alike.

# Future add ons:
You can 100% add a webacam or camera to this easilly and make it usable for calls and videos with a bluetooth headset. Imagine being able to simeltaneously call someone while working on an essay all in your hands! Techinacally, you can even open it up and use the usb c 
port for running programs, powering other devices etc. also the fact that you can connect ethernet and use the other GPIO pins to make something cool allows this to be entirely customizable, with even art on the shell! While its not in main use, you call also set it up to 
be a clock on your desk, or a set of reminders for the day, or even a fully functional weather screen. You can even plug in some wireless sensors to monitor your plants while you are on the go or use it to monitor your ring camera at all times from your desk!.
