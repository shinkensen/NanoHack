Found an reaserched every part and how i actually going to make this (4 hours) and basically finished the cad (The current sittuation is just me working on the removable underside) (4 hours). I am so tired, going to bed now, technically I started this yesterday but didnt make a journal entry
Made 3 cad models, one with the internals and correct sizes, one with the screen on, and the last one is the actual 3d print.

6/22/25-Finished up and perfected snaplock mechanishm, took in feedback from people on slack, and reaserched how I can do this propperly (Ie the exact OS setup and stuff). spent about 4-5 hours total doing this. 
I'm really kindof excited for this and I have reached out to multiple 3d print people in the legion thing, i had saved about $12 in the budget for a shipping label but looks like its going to end up $10 or less, I
won't know fully untill I place the order so i'm saving the $2 for like tarrifs/fees/ and other unexpected expenses.Going to go submit soon and start working on Summer of Making!
