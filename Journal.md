Found an reaserched every part and how i actually going to make this (4 hours) and basically finished the cad (The current sittuation is just me working on the removable underside) (4 hours). I am so tired, going to bed now, technically I started this yesterday but didnt make a journal entry
Made 3 cad models, one with the internals and correct sizes, one with the screen on, and the last one is the actual 3d print.
