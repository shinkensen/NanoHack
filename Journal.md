Found an reaserched every part and how i actually going to make this (4 hours) and basically finished the cad (The current sittuation is just me working on the removable underside) (4 hours). I am so tired, going to bed now, technically I started this yesterday but didnt make a journal entry
Made 3 cad models, one with the internals and correct sizes, one with the screen on, and the last one is the actual 3d print.

-Finished up and perfected snaplock mechanishm, took in feedback from people on slack, and reaserched how I can do this propperly (Ie the exact OS setup and stuff). spent about 4-5 hours total doing this. 
I'm really kindof excited for this and I have reached out to multiple 3d print people in the legion thing, i had saved about $12 in the budget for a shipping label but looks like its going to end up $10 or less, I
won't know fully untill I place the order so i'm saving the $2 for like tarrifs/fees/ and other unexpected expenses.Going to go submit soon and start working on Summer of Making!

I spent the whole day working on a custom pcb replacement for the adafruit 1000c. spent the begginning hours learning how to do this and creating the schematic. (Ive never done this before so i had to start from scratch) spent 4 hours on that :( and took a crap load of thinking and learing about electric curcuits and parts. The next 2 hours I spent learning how tf footprints work, what they are, and mapping each individual part to its foot print and making they are compatible, then exporting and troubleshooting the gerber files and utilizing multipe setting configurations and gerber viewers until I finally got it okay. I then followed that up with 2 hours fo straight BOMing, reaserching pcp vendors and pricing and cross comparing, and also reaserching each and every single part and adding it to the bom wile also calculating shipping and taxes to make sure it is compatible with its footprint (was really tedious but glad i got it done). Learning all this was kinda cool but im kinda scarred to hand solder it and getting all the parts was rlly annoying. Here are some images of the final BOM, Schematics, and PCB layout![Screenshot 2025-06-23 144704](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c37ea9a3-8ac2-47a9-8378-74aae6eb9fe9)
